    Subtracts 1 from the sum of distinct partitions p_d(n). Problem statement

    Applies Euler's Pentagonal Theorem: 
    sum of distinct partitions p_d(n) == sum of odd partitions p_0(n)
    p_d(n) = SUM(A_k + p(n-1**2) - p(n-2**2) - p(n-3**2) + p(n - 4**2) ...
        for all n-k**2 >= 0
    values of p(n-k**2) when n-k**2 < 0 are 0 and can be ignored

    The A_k term is +/- 1 when n is a pentagonal number, 0 for others

    Solution resolves to member of integer sequence OEIS A000009
    Time complexity is O(2**n) before cacheing, closer to O(n**2) with cache
